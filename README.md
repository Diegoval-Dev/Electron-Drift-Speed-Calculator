# Electron Drift Speed Calculator

![Electron Drift Speed](screenshot.png)

## Description

This repository contains the source code for the **Electron Drift Speed Calculator**, a program that simulates the behavior of electrons in a cylindrical wire subjected to an applied voltage. The program takes various parameters as input and calculates essential electrical properties, including resistance, current, power dissipation, electron drift speed, and the time it takes for electrons to traverse the wire.

The program offers a bonus feature, allowing you to visualize electron motion within the wire. Additionally, there's an option to represent atomic interactions and simulate electron movement as a random walk.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Simulation Notes

- Electron drift speed is visually represented with a scale factor for visibility since real electron velocities are extremely small.
- Bonus: Activate the option to visualize atomic interactions and electron random walks for a more detailed simulation.
